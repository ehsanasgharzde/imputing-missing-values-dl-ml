## Missing Value Imputation Program (Version 1)

This program is designed to impute missing values in datasets using a combination of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods. This is Version 1 of the program.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the repository containing this program.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the program's directory.

4. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
   - Make sure your dataset contains missing values that you want to impute.

5. Open the `main.py` file in a code editor.

6. Update the `dataset_path` variable with the path to your dataset file.

7. Customize the imputation methods and parameters in the script according to your requirements. You can choose from various DL and ML imputation methods available.

8. Run the script as needed to perform missing value imputation.

9. The program will perform missing value imputation and provide the imputed dataset as output.

## Imputation Methods

This program supports multiple DL and ML imputation methods, which can be customized in the `main.py` file. Some common imputation methods include:
- Deep Learning (e.g., autoencoders)
- Linear Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Output

The program will generate an imputed dataset, which you can save to a file for further analysis.

## Version History

- Version 1: Initial release with basic imputation methods.
- (Future Versions): Planned updates with additional features and methods.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions to improve this program. Feel free to create issues or pull requests in the repository.

Happy imputing!
